/**
 * Cut text to a byte budget on a line boundary, optionally resuming later.
 *
 * The continuation is what makes a budget honest. Truncating and dropping the
 * rest is fine for a reply nobody needs the end of, and wrong for the one
 * section in a real map that is larger than every page but its own: the agent
 * gets a body that stops mid-argument with no way to ask for the remainder. The
 * returned `nextOffset` is the byte position to pass back in, and it always
 * advances — a single line larger than the whole budget is returned whole
 * rather than producing a continuation that never moves.
 *
 * @param text - the text to cap.
 * @param maxBytes - budget in UTF-8 bytes; a non-positive value disables it.
 * @param offset - byte offset to resume from; 0 starts at the beginning.
 * @returns the window, whether anything follows it, and where to resume.
